## A mental health and lifestyle blog for Canadian international students

This is my first attempt at building a static website after I completed freeCodeCamp's Responsive design Course. Main focus of the project is to validate the HTML elements and CSS stylings I learnt during the course.

- Responsive Web design
- HTML elements
- CSS styles
- CSS animations
- CSS variables
