              The one thing I would tell my 18 year old self
            </h3>
            <p class="post-summary">
              It all started when I got admission at 18 to study my dream course
              at the University of Airdrie. I had to take the bold step of
              leaving behind everything I've ever known - family, friends,
              culture. Looking back at things now, What would I tell my 18 year
              old self if I met her today?

              School-Work-Life Balance: how to strike the right balance?
            </h3>

              One of the most challenging issues facing international students
              in Canada is how to strike the right balance between work, social
              life, and school.

              I realized that hundreds of thousands of Canadian international
              students like go through similar struggles and challenges when it
              comes to settling in the new environment, excelling in school,
              working to make ends meet, and so on. So I decided to create a
              platform where we can all share our mental struggles and know that
              "Hey, you are not alone in this".
